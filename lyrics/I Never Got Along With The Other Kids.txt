I never got along with the other kids
Don't think I ever will
I just try not to kill them
Sorry mother sorry girlfriends
I swear I did my best
With faulty parts I was given

And so I dance dance dance
By myself self self self self
Don't care about pretty eyelashes
Don't case that your outfit matches
